Bundletool is a tool to manipulate Android App Bundles.

The **Android App Bundle** is a new format for publishing Android apps in app
distribution stores such as Google Play.

Bundletool has a few different responsibilities:

*   **Build an Android App Bundle** from pre-compiled modules of a project.

*   **Generate an APK Set archive** containing APKs for all possible devices.

*   **Extract APK(s)** from the APK Set compatible with a given device.

*   **Install APK(s)** from the APK Set compatible with a connected device.

*   **Extract device spec** from a device as a JSON file.
